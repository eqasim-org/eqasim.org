**The website has recently been updated.** Some more information about the packaged MATSim distribution of of eqasim will be available here soon, including information on the two major tweaks compared to the standard configuration of MATSim:

- The use of **discrete choice models** for decision-making instead of the co-evolutionary scoring approach.
- The use of **volume delay function** traffic dynamcis instead of the detailed queue dynamics implemented in standard MATSim.

For the time being, have a look at the [eqasim-java repository](https://github.com/eqasim-org/eqasim-java) which contains all the relevant code and some documentation.
