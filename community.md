The development of eqasim started at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) where it is still actively being used and improved at the [Center for Sustainable Future Mobility](https://csfm.ethz.ch/en/). Their main interest focuses on the implementation for Switzerland and the use of eqasim in applied transport planning.

[tellae](https://www.tellae.fr/) is an innovative consulting firm specialized in cities transportation issues. They play a key role in the maintenance of eqasim and provide components for improving the demand generation process. They use the demand data as input to their open-source shared mobility simulator [Starling](https://github.com/tellae/starling) and their transport planning platform [Kite](https://kite.tellae.fr/).

At [Gustave Eiffel University](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/), various research labs such as [SPLOTT](https://splott.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/) and [GRETTIA](https://splott.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/) are actively involved in the further development of eqasim. Among others, they are interested in coupling eqasim with large scale noise evaluation processes using the open-source [NoiseModeling](https://noise-planet.org/noisemodelling.html) framework.
